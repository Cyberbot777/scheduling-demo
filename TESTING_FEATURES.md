## How to Test

1. **Start the servers**:

   # Terminal 1 - Backend
   cd backend
   npm start
   
   # Terminal 2 - Frontend
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to Providers page**: http://localhost:3000/providers

3. **Test each feature**:
   - **Search**: Type in the search box
   - **Filter**: Use the dropdown filters
   - **Sort**: Use the sort controls
   - **Pagination**: Use Prev/Next buttons
   - **Clear**: Use "Clear All Filters" button

## API Endpoints

The backend supports these query parameters:
- `page`: Page number (default: 1)
- `limit`: Items per page (default: 10)
- `specialty`: Filter by specialty
- `day`: Filter by day of week
- `time`: Filter by hour (0-23)
- `search`: Search in name and specialty
- `sortBy`: Sort field (name, specialty)
- `sortOrder`: Sort direction (asc, desc)

## Sample API Calls

```bash
# Basic pagination
curl "http://localhost:4000/providers?page=1&limit=9"

# Search
curl "http://localhost:4000/providers?search=alice"

# Filter by specialty
curl "http://localhost:4000/providers?specialty=Doula"

# Filter by day and time
curl "http://localhost:4000/providers?day=monday&time=9"

# Sort
curl "http://localhost:4000/providers?sortBy=name&sortOrder=asc"

# Combined
curl "http://localhost:4000/providers?page=1&limit=9&search=alice&specialty=Doula&sortBy=name&sortOrder=asc"
```

## Next Steps for Indexing

The next feature to implement would be database indexing to improve performance:

1. **Add database indexes** for frequently queried fields
2. **Implement full-text search** for better search capabilities
3. **Add caching** for repeated queries
4. **Optimize availability filtering** with database-level queries

## Performance Notes

- Search is debounced to prevent excessive API calls
- Filtering happens on the backend for better performance
- Pagination is server-side to handle large datasets
- All filters can be combined for complex queries
